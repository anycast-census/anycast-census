0. THE MANYCASTR PROJECT

The MAnycastR project provides a daily census of anycast;
including detection, enumeration, and geolocation.

that redistribution takes place under the same terms, and that you give
appropriate credit to the source of the data, as stipulated under clause 2

Any redistribution of (parts of) MAnycastR open access data MUST include an

2. ATTRIBUTION

If you make use of any of the open access data from the MAnycastR project,
you must acknowledge use of this data by including the following attribution
in any document, web page or other communication:

"The research leading to these results was made possible by the 
MAnycastR project (https://github.com/anycast-census/anycast-census/).‚Äù

Furthermore, if you use open access data from the MAnycastR project for
research that is published in a scientific paper, poster or other peer
reviewed content, the paper you must cite is to be announced
(pending publication). Contact anycastcensus@gmail.com for details.

3. USE OF THE DOWNLOAD SERVICE

Persons and/or organisations that wish to download data that is made available
by the MAnycastR project through its public servers must take reasonable
measures to ensure that the servers do not experience undue load
because of excessive downloads or automated processes. The MAnycastR project
reserves the right to block downloads from any location or address without
prior notice. Any abuse will be reported to appropriate abuse contact points.

In general we note that datasets are updated once every 24 hours, thus, down-
loading data more frequently than once per calendar day is generally not
useful.
