31/05/2024 - GCD measurements are now performed using the Ark platform, instead of MAnycastR nodes
19/06/2024 - Added list of previously found anycast prefixes that are always checked with GCD. (increasing number of daily IPv4 /24s found with GCD from ~12.1k to ~12.3k)
23/07/2024 - Added MAnycastR nodes to Ark. (GCD lower bound enumeration of large anycast deployments (e.g., CloudFlare) increased by ~20% for IPv4, ~60% for IPv6), (GCD number of anycast prefixes detected increased by ~0.7% and ~1.5% for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively)
10/08/2024 - Updated IPv6 hitlist, TUM (~150 additional anycast /48s found)
14/08/2024 - Expanded IPv4, IPv6 hitlist using anycatch and public-dns.info addresses (~100, ~230 additional anycast prefixes found for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively)
15/08/2024 - Added AAAA record addresses for domain names that point to IPv4 anycast addresses (~10 additional anycasted /48s found)
22/08/2024 <-> 04/09/2024 - Technical problems with pipeline, limiting results in both detection and enumeration.
05/09/2024 - Added 'stats' file to daily upload, giving statistics about daily upload. Including number of available nodes used in the GCD measurement (as it affects performance)
13/11/2024 - Updated IPv6 hitlist (both TUM and OI addresses)
21/11/2024 - Updated IPv4 hitlist (12.1k -> 12.7k IPv4 GCD-confirmed anycast /24s) 




NOTE: 'stats' file from 31/05/2024 till 04/09/2024 has wrong number of GCD nodes reported
